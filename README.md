## Hi there 👋
Hello! I am Gayathri, an Astronomer at Stockholm University, from <img src="Git icons/tree.png" width="30" /> Kerala, India.

 <img src="Git icons/job.png" width="30" /> I detect and characterize young planets around distant stars using powerful telescopes and high-contrast tools, in an effort to understand how planets like Jupiter form.

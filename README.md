## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I am Gayathri, an Astronomer at Stockholm University, from <img src="Git icons/tree.png" width="30" /> Kerala, India.

 <img src="Git icons/job.png" width="30" /> I detect and characterize young planets around distant stars using powerful telescopes and high-contrast tools, in an effort to understand how planets like Jupiter form. 

Programming Languages: <img src="Git icons/python.png" width="40" /> <img src="Git icons/sql.png" width="40" /> <img src="Git icons/Cpp.png" width="40" /> 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a Data science enthusiast and am currently learning Machine Learning and its applications to my research. I am constantly looking for new opportunities and challenges to expand my skills in data processing, analysis and visualization.
